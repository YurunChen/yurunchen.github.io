# üßê About Me 
I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. at Zhejiang University.
My research interests lie primarily in the areas of LLM/Agent security.

If you are interested in my work or would like to discuss potential academic cooperation, please feel free to contact me via email.

            <p><strong>Yurun Chen</strong>, Xavier Hu, Keting Yin, Juncheng Li, Shengyu Zhang</p>
            <p class="paper-description">This paper investigates the vulnerability of multimodal agents to active environmental injection attacks, where adversaries can manipulate the agent's environment to cause misbehavior. We propose a comprehensive evaluation framework and demonstrate that current agents are susceptible to various attack vectors.</p>
